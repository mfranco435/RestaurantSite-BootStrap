# RestaurantSite-BootStrap
Restaurant Website [BootStrap].

This is a responsive website I completed following along instructional videos for BootStrap.The website is designed to change the placement of the different sections on the website as the web browser window is made bigger and smaller. It is a mock up of a website that would be developed for a food service establishment.  It is for a "" restaurant Riverside Inn Steak House.

As I coded the website as instructed I got to use and become familiar with the web development tools that are provided in some web browser like GoogleChrome. I got to use the preview tools that allow you to see what the website would look like on different screen resoultions or on different devices that made it convient to restructure or confirm that the website would not have an unpleasant view on uncommon, or even smaller cellphone screen type of devices.
